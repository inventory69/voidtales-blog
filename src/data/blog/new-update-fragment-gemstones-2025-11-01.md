As some of you following Void Tales might already know, gemstones can greatly affect the way you fight.  
Some of them empower your critical strikes, others reduce your cooldowns, and a few even enhance your abilities directly.  

Until now, there have been Rift, Hollow, and Vessel gemstones, as well as the rare Bleak Gemstones, which strengthen the cursed blade Loyalty, and the lost Heirloom Gemstones, known for granting you power at the cost of another.  

Now, something new has emerged: Fragment Gemstones.  
There are seven of them in total, each representing one of Phiaâ€™s fragments â€” the ancient deities themselves.  

Youâ€™ve already awakened Ibis, the first of Phiaâ€™s children.  
In the future, she will offer you a gift â€” and if youâ€™ve already met her, simply speak to her again.  

These gemstones allow you to use fragments of divine talent and forgotten power into your own combat flow, reflecting aspects of each deityâ€™s essence.  

I think this is a really exciting addition to the combat system,  but I wonâ€™t spoil too much.  
Youâ€™ll have to discover how they truly work for yourselves.  

And yes, Phiaâ€™s behavior has been slightly adjusted when you offer your favorite moth the artifactâ€¦ so she can awaken the potential within it.  

From now on, @everyone  can shape their build even more precisely! And feeling more powerful with every deity they awake.  

In the end, this is your task, your purpose.  

I hope you will like it! We go a step closer every day.  

Only For You, Shin ðŸ¦‰
