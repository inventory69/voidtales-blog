Things have been a little quiet around here lately @everyone, and maybe one or two of you, maybe even eight – who knows – have wondered: what happened to Void Tales? Or maybe it’s just me, and no one really cares, haha. But honestly, I want to give you a proper update.

Some of you already know that I’ve been through two very rough weeks, which left me with almost no time to work on the server. Compared to the usual pace I set myself, it felt microscopic. And yet, for those who know me, you’ll believe me when I say it truly breaks my heart to see Void Tales in its current state – a broken HUD, an overloaded server filled with entities but no players, and on top of that, me ignoring the Discord for two weeks with a guilty conscience.

But there’s good news too. I’m happy to share that the the test server – the one that will soon replace the live server – is running beautifully. Smooth performance, a stunning HUD, and some really exciting features. I’m currently working on something I’ve long wanted to bring into Void Tales: a true nemesis, the Void Monarch. It’s shaping up into a spectacle, almost like a stage performance. I’ve been pickier than ever with this creature, because nothing feels perfect enough. But it has to be. After all, it’s Void Tales – the first encounter with the Void must be unforgettable.

Progress is slower right now, but I’m still moving forward. Here’s what remains on my list:

Finishing the encounter with the Void Monarch

Designing the Boss Challenges (divine versions of bosses to fight)

Bringing back custom Void Tales achievements, now with two new tabs: Adventures and NPC Encounters

A bit of testing : D

That’s it for now. Thank you for your patience, your spirit, and for being the soul of this project. My love for Void Tales will never fade – and neither will my love for the community that makes it alive.

See you soon.
