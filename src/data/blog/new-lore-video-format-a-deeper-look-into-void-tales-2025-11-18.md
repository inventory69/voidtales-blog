As some of you already know, the lore of Void Tales is deeply interwoven and luckily, many of you here enjoy digging into it just as much as I do.  

**I’ve decided to put more time and effort into these videos, and I’m happy to say that this new format reflects that.**  

This series will explore the background stories of the world in a way that’s easy to enjoy for @everyone , even if you don’t talk to every NPC or read every item description.  

I started with one of the most important foundations of Void Tales:  
the ever-present influence of **Insanity**, and the tragic conflict between **Phia** & **Faelan**.  
And of course, our favorite cursed blade makes an appearance: **Loyalty**.  

I hope you enjoy this new format — and maybe it helps you see Void Tales from a different angle.  
More is coming soon.  

Excited: Your Shin!

P.S.  

It means the world to me let people know of this project. If you enjoyed the video feel free to show it other people who could like Void Tales eventually ❤️
