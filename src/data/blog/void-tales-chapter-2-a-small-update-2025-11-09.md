Hey @everyone,  

I know it’s been quiet here lately, but believe me, I’ve been pouring a lot of work into Chapter 2 of Void Tales. Honestly, it’s been a bit overwhelming — the desert region is huge, and after how polished Chapter 1 turned out (with only a few bugs left), I’ve developed a kind of perfectionist streak. I just can’t do anything half-hearted or generic.  

That said, there are still some things waiting beyond Chapter 2, but I wanted to share a little sneak peek with you.  

Chapter 2 takes place in Aridia, the city of Aridos, the fox god. He’s worshiped as the god of rain and hidden things, and true to his title, the people of Aridia owe their rain — and their lush greenery — to this proud, whiskered deity.  

The Aridians themselves are full of life: they celebrate, they enjoy plants, festivals, and everything in between. But the desert surrounding them tells a different story.  

The Mareth Desert wasn’t always a barren wasteland — it was once a vast sea. I wanted to move away from the generic desert tropes, like the lone oasis or oversized ruins inspired by other games. Mareth had massive coral reefs and a seafaring civilization, now reduced to remnants: giant dead corals, sun-bleached shells scattered across the sands.  

This theme carries deep lore — the remnants of this people, the spirit of the ancient sea, roaming gnolls, Aridos’ failed experiments, a suddenly appearing floating tower, coral stone temples of the seafarers, the Fox Archive hovering above the desert, and of course, the bustling life of Aridia itself. In the middle of this chaos, there’s also the organization that has been waiting for the Awakened… that’s you.  

I truly believe this can be something incredible. Think of all the story threads: upgrades for the Given Blade, Loyalty, a mysterious new secondary weapon, gemstones, letters, new friends, and the evolving conflict between Phia and Faelan.  

Yes, it’s challenging. I’ll admit — in terms of lore and worldbuilding, we’re probably a bit more… special than most. And I’m proud of that. Sometimes I fly across the desert, up and down, left and right, and wonder: Where do I even begin? Is this spot too empty? It’s overwhelming, but in a good way.  

My goal is simple: I want to create a beautiful, memorable experience for all of you.  

Thanks for sticking with me, and I can’t wait to share more soon.
