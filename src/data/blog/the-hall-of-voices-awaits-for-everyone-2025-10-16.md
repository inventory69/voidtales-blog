At long last, the Hall of Voices has opened its gates once more.  
An ancient trial ground of Ibya, where believers, zealots, and scholars once tested their devotion to earn her favor.  
Many who entered never returned!  

The ruins slowly drown in the swamp below and toxic vines and fumes crawl up the stones, and deep within, Ava still stands, ever eager to test the next challenger in the Trial of Strength. She can hardly contain her excitement to hear the bell ring againâ€¦ before she slams her opponent into the ground.  

Thanks to  , his scripting mastery, and his persistence, we finally have a fully working dungeon system!  
It tracks defeated bosses, resets spawners when no one remains inside, and does so without relying on instanced worlds or persistent totems, making each run feel alive, and full of atmosphere. Expect music, challenge, and a perfect chance to gather Glimmer!  

As a small celebration, every adventurer can now claim a Hall of Voices Key for just 1 gold using /key.  
Bring your friends, one key is enough for your entire party.  

Go on, test your strength... the bell is ringing once again.
