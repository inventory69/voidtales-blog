Hey @everyone! We’ve just rolled out a little patch that makes a huge difference – here’s what’s new:  

🦙  Ellums Reworked  

They now look much more charming and even have their own petting animation!  

Ellums are the national pride of Ibya – feel free to visit them anytime.  

Even better: You can now choose one of the 3 adorable Ellums to become your lifelong companion – a fully functional mount (no more getting stuck!) with its own special skill: a speed boost!   

To bond with one, feed it a Special Carrot:  

Reward for completing the Ellum quest (at the beginning).  

If you’ve already done the quest: simply type /ellum to claim it for free.  

Old broken vouchers will be cleaned up soon.  

⚔️ Oak Sword Upgrade  

Thanks to s idea, the Oak Sword has received a stylish upgrade!  

It bridges the gap between Oak Sword and Loyalty (now +1 damage).  

Find the NPC in Ibya Forest, right before the clearing at the end.  

If you notice any balance issues, let us know!  

📖 Mobile Guide Book  

You can now always access your guide!  

Simply buy it from the Chrono Courier (vending machine) for a small price.  

The guide contains lots of useful info and even lists all your active quests.  

⚡ Quick Note  
We had to push this patch a bit quicker than usual due to some unexpected issues, so the server went down briefly. Normally we handle this with more polish on the test server – thanks for your patience! Everything should now be running smoothly.  

✅ /ellum or complete the quest → unlock the cutest mount you’ve ever seen  
✅ NPC in Ibya Forest → Oak Sword upgrade  
✅ Chrono Courier → buy your mobile Guide Book  

Have fun, and enjoy the update! 💙  

&nbsp;  

Before I forget! You'll probably need to download the new version of the modpack for this. I'm very sorry!
