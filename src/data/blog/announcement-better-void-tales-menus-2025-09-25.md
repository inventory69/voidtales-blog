Weâ€™ve updated the main menu and all submenus in Void Tales â€” removing a bunch of unnecessary buttons for a cleaner, fancier look.

To see these changes, youâ€™ll need to download the new version of the modpack. I totally understand how annoying it can be to constantly redo your settings, so donâ€™t worry: these changes are purely cosmetic and not important at all. <#1398423296856297563> 

That means you can delay downloading the update as long as you like â€” no rush at all ðŸ˜„

Have fun!
