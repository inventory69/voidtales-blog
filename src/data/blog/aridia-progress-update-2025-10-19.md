The arrival of the train has caused quite a stir in **Aridia**. Most of the city, and @everyone else,  is already in an uproar preparing for the upcoming Fox Festival, and some even claim to have predicted the appearance of the Awakened.  

At the heart of the city stands the Soluna Spire, a place marked by the calm, unshakable nature typical of Aridian life, even amidst layers of bureaucracy. Only the new Chief, Meirion, seems untouched by that calm. Young, ambitious, and clearly overwhelmed, sheâ€™s one of the few who genuinely tries to bring change.   
The building itself once served as a great basin for collecting sacred rainwater, back when every drop was seen as a blessing, before Aridos.  

The Desert Rose Quarters have been completely rebuilt. Where once stood six dull, sun-bleached buildings, now rise over a dozen colorful, beautifully decorated homes in traditional Aridian style. Wandering through the alleys or across the rooftop terraces, some even connected by ziplines, feels incredible. **I mean that**.  

For the Fox Festival, the people have even raised a massive Ellum piÃ±ata (I just don't have an immersive name for it yet, sorry), a creature from faraway Ibya. To most Aridians, Ellums are mythical â€” symbols from a world they only know through stories since the Shattering pulled their lands apart.  

The Trade Winds Alley offers space for merchants of all kinds, honest, cunning, and everything in between. Be careful who you bargain with.  

At the Reed & Rose Teahouse, gossip and rumors flow as freely as the tea itself. Tired travelers and locals alike gather here to unwind. Downstairs, a small steam bath welcomes those who need a moment to breathe. And yes â€” Nessa, the Tea Mistress, really does live up to her reputation.  

Beyond the city lies the Mareth Desert, once an ocean. Few dare to cross the bridge. **Aridosâ€™ rain ends there**. Beyond that line, the sand belongs to those the city has forgotten, the exiled, the lost, the ones who never found the Foxâ€™s favor.  

Iâ€™ve rebuilt everything â€” the entire desert is gone, cleared away. But it will be worth it. As always, Iâ€™m here, building a world that deserves to be loved. Chapter 2 is still far from finished, but I promise â€” itâ€™s going to be something truly special.  

**And yes, the brochure this time contains no AI slop.**  

P.S  

I am really proud of how the update is going so far. Since I am building and developing the content on my own, it will still take some time. (If anyone would like to join us and is interested, just get in touch.)
