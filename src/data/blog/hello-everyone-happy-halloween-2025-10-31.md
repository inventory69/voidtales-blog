Did you know that Ylien used to celebrate a festival?  

Before Hjortun put his city into an eternal dream so that he could be with its inhabitants when his eternal sleep began, a blasphemous festival was celebrated in secret, during which people placed carved pumpkins in front of their doors.   

Since corruption, fear, and despair have trapped everyone, including Hjortun, in a city of eternal nightmares, this festival no longer plays a role.  

But you can still celebrate it.  
I must admit that I haven't had much time to prepare it, but if you're at Soul Station, you should receive a nice package!  

Thank you for everything!  
Yours, Shin!
