For a long time, this project has been defined by time.  

I have spent over 10 years working on this world.  
More than 10,000 hours of building systems, writing lore, creating NPCs, mechanics, quests, places.  

For most of that time, I believed that more content meant a better game for @everyone .  
I kept adding, expanding, stacking ideas on top of ideas.  

At some point, I had to face a hard truth:  
What I had built was large, but not sharp.  
There was quantity, but not the level of quality I truly wanted.  

Three years ago, I made a drastic decision.  
I locked most of the game and focused only on a single quarter of it.  
That became Chapter 1.  

Those three years were not wasted. They taught me a lot.  
But recently, I realized something painful: even that was not enough.  

I had raised my standards again.  
And this time, the gap between my ambition and my output hit me hard.  

I won’t hide this:  
That realization broke me for a while.  
It affected my motivation, my mental health, and my ability to communicate.  

But I’m back now — with clarity.  

What changed  

My goal is no longer “a big Minecraft server”.  
My goal is to create something that can stand next to modern indie games, in tone, cohesion, and care.  

That comes with consequences.  

I am extremely slow when working at this level.  
Some days, I spend an entire day on two NPCs.  
That is not inefficiency — that is the cost of depth, consistency, and intention.  

From now on, quality defines the pace, not expectations.  

What this means for the game  

There will be a visible cut in the game.  

Players will encounter moments where older content meets newer content.  
That line will exist. It will be noticeable.  
And over time, it will slowly move backward as more of the world is rebuilt.  

This process will take a long time.  
Not weeks. Not months. Likely years.  

I am no longer pretending otherwise.  

How I will work from now on  

Every piece of content will be created as a complete, coherent unit:  

Designed carefully  

Documented properly  

Integrated into the world  

Explained openly  

I am documenting everything in a structured way.  
Lore, mechanics, design decisions — nothing lives only in my head anymore.  

You will see less frequent updates, but each one will mean something.  

How I will communicate  

I won’t disappear again — but I also won’t flood you with noise.  

Instead, I will:  

Share clear development logs  

Explain why decisions are made, not just what changes  

Show progress through concrete examples, not promises  

Silence in the past was not a lack of care.  
It was the result of carrying too much alone.  

That changes now.  

What comes next  

This project is no longer about finishing everything.  
It is about building something honest, deliberate, and lasting.  

If you are here for fast content, this may not be for you.  
If you are here to watch a world slowly take shape with intention, you are welcome to stay.  

Thank you for your patience.  
Thank you for being here at all.  

What comes next will be slower —  
but it will finally be true to what this project was always meant to be.  

Better And Back - Your Shin ❤️
