So i did speed up the deployment process dramatically.
Now you can really call it atomic swap, because it gets deployed with rsync which is MUCH MUCH faster.
It only should take about 40 seconds for the step.
So in general you can wait ~1 Minute for the whole process to be done and then you can see the blog post.
