This is going to be a somewhat unusual and, above all, unimmersive announcement for you and @everyone else. I feel like one of those people who have messed up and then have to apologize publicly haha!  

No, I don't have to, but I want to. My eyes were opened today, and I'm a little ashamed now. Some of you may know that we recently lost a team member due to differences of opinion. He believed we were using too much AI, or in his words, AI slop.  

I always thought: Why? What's the point? They're just pictures. I can't draw, so I create images to spruce things up a bit.  

**“You're actually using AI that devalues your project.”**  

**“It betrays the creative passion.”**  

These are the words of someone who means well, which I understood today. They are the same words that the team member in question used when I didn't understand them yet. **Void Tales is not an AI server**; what we excel at most is the lore, the atmosphere, and our small but wonderful community. I don't want to devalue these things anymore. I sound like I'm just repeating what these people said, but I understood something important today.  

I hereby solemnly promise that we, or rather I, will distance ourselves from any kind of AI content in the future, even if it's just thumbnails, images supporting announcements, or Void Tales' own new menu. Unfortunately, it's true that this poisons the artistic spirit and beautiful soul of this project at its core.  

I am in contact with someone who will create **our own server logo**, and I also spent several hours today revising all the thumbnails. I will also change the Void Tales menu and make it more attractive, not because I feel ashamed or guilty, but because the artistic spirit demands it.  

This message is for everyone who follows our project, and thank you to everyone who reads it and meant it well for us. And thank you to that special person who wrote to me today!  

P.S.  

You may think that I didn't need to make this announcement, or that it was perhaps excessive, but I'm not doing this to make myself look better, but rather to prevent Void Tales from being disgraced or dragged through the mud in the future. So that means I have to do this, and I want to do it!  

Your Shin
