There are two or three, maybe even four people who have tested Void Tales to its limits, completed it, and explored it.  

(For those who don't know, there are actually already 4 chapters, but only Chapter 1 has been reopened because it has been adapted to our new and almost perfectionist standard).  

I am now addressing everyone else who has only started Void Tales and then stopped, or even just seen a trailer and become curious but then decided not to play.  

I am very interested in what prevented you from continuing to play. What was the point that just didn't hook you?  

I recently conducted a survey, but accidentally set it to only 24 hours. I would be very happy if you could participate in the new survey!  

In my biased developer eyes, I think Void Tales is something truly wonderful, and I would like to know where I am wrong : )  

Yours, Shin!
