So @everyone … I really thought I’d be done with the update today. I even took my sweet time (and I actually enjoyed it a lot!) — but it still wasn’t enough.

Here’s where things stand right now:

Performance Issues [X]

New HUD [X]

New Monster [X]

New Area [X]

Better Shops [X]

Parkour Leaderboards [X]

Bug Fixes [X]

New Formless Mass Ability [X]

New Travel Mechanic [X]

Better Item Descriptions [X]

Falwhind Performance Overhaul [X]

Soul Station Performance Overhaul [X]

Ibis Island Performance Overhaul [X]

Grove Of Deities Performance Overhaul [X]

Ibya Forest Performance Overhaul [X]

Umon Performance Overhaul [X]

Sanctuary Performance Overhaul [ ]

Hall Of Voices Performance Overhaul [ ]

New Lore Book Store [ ]

Progress will slow down a bit now since my 4 days off are over :/
But thank you all for sticking with me! Without you, there would be no Void Tales.

Once this update is stable and out, we’ll finally have a clean and solid foundation to build on. This time for real…




Oh, and just by the way: Performance Overhaul means in plain language:

I work with two tab groups, old and new server, and transfer everything cleanly and securely, change every item, and add something here and there! After each step, the console is checked to ensure there are no gaps, just in case anyone is interested.

See you soon!
