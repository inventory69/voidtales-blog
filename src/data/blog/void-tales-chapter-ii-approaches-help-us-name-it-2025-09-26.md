@everyone ! The sands are shifting, and the next chapter of Void Tales is beginning to take form.
After your journey through Ibya, the Awakened will soon board Emmeline, the forgotten train whose rusted rails cut through the desert and lead into the heart of Aridia — a city of radiant festivals, hidden pride, and shadows buried in the dunes.

Aridia is a land of contrasts: within its walls, joy and revelry thrive, while beyond them lie forgotten temples, fractured factions, and the weight of a prophecy. Already, whispers speak of a substance said to hold both reflection and revelation… and many seek to claim it for their own.

Chapter II will bring:
✨ The continuation of your main quest: awaken Aridos, the Pride and Ambition — God of the Hidden and the Rain.
✨ New challenges that test not only your strength, but your place in the unfolding story.
✨ Expanding lore — the journey of the Awakened deepens, and Aridia reveals its hidden truths.
✨ The capital of Aridia, alive with vibrant encounters and festivities.
✨ Outer deserts, where ruins and temples wait to thrust terrible powers into the wrong hands.
✨ A floating tower — each faction sees it as a different symbol, though none dare ask what stirs within.
✨ The Archives, where mischievous foxes feast on melons, spin riddles, and play pranks without end.
✨ And even more places I won’t spoil just yet…

The rails ahead are shrouded in sand and secrecy, but one thing is certain: the train is moving again, and the desert is waiting. 🌵

⚠️ Important: Many of these locations have existed in Void Tales for a long time, but I’ll be reworking them — reshaping and adapting them to today’s Void Tales standards. The time this takes? Written in the stars.

🌟 Now it’s your turn!
Chapter II needs a name — and I want you to help choose it. Share your ideas, and let’s give this new chapter the name it deserves. <#1421258875251724338>
