I’ve kept my promise.  
All AI-generated art has been completely removed.  

While the old ones were only pixel-art filters, I wanted Void Tales to be built purely by hand — with effort, patience, and honesty. I’ve spent hours crafting a brand new menu background for @everyone , editing it piece by piece. It might not be perfect… but it’s real. (Im not that good in such things)  

That means our main menu has been entirely remade, and it now even features a new title theme! I’m still not fully satisfied with the title text yet — but that will come in time.  

I’ve also added a few new models to Void Tales, including a new desert mount (no spoilers for now 👀).  
But beware… the new main foes won’t be something to take lightly.  

So it could be that you need to download the newest version from the modpack in <#1398423296856297563>
