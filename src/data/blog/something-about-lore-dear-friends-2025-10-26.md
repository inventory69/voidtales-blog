As some of you know, Void Tales is full of lore, atmosphere, and interesting characters.  

Not many of you like that, and not @everyone is a lore enthusiast like some here (I'm looking at one particular druid).  

But don't worry, Void Tales may be crammed with lore, but it's not shoved in your face. Those who seek it will find it.  

I've been developing this lore for over 13 years, it has changed, been added to, sometimes briefly contradicted itself, which was quickly changed, and above all, it has flourished.  

It slowly began to dawn on me that I was losing track of individual details, and that's a very bad feeling. Fortunately, the same druid recommended a medium to me, and today I went through all my NPCs, item descriptions, and locations to finally categorize and organize everything.  

I would just like to show you what has come together, and as I said, don't worry, this lore will be presented to you in the form of NPCs, environmental storytelling, and items.  

I spent almost 7 hours today writing all this down, so FULL NERD MODE. I'm not done yet, as you can see from the gray dots.  

All this is to help spread the lore better around the world in the future, and it's a necessary step to move on to Chapter 2.  

Some people may be wondering: who cares? But of course, lore isn't for everyone, but I value it.  

PASSION!
