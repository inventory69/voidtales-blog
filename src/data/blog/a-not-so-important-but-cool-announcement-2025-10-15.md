All parkour courses have been replaced and improved. This time, no one will have any items stolen or be forced to use any strange second inventory. It's simple, fun, and does what it's supposed to do.  

Oh, and of course I had to update the leaderboards. That means you can immortalize yourselves as the fastest once again! (sorry)  

Oh, and there are always times when I work on Void Tales for more than 12 hours a day, and I really enjoy doing so! And then there are other times, like now, for example. I'm happy if I can manage one or two hours a day, and sometimes I can't even get to my laptop! But as always: it's... moving... forward! Toward a bright future or something like that!  

I love you guys! (Somehow I really do : P)
