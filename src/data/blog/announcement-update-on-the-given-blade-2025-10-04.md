Hey @everyone!  

We’ve been facing some issues with the **Given Blade**, the broken sword of the gods. The mechanics are working pretty well – I even added a “spam punisher” so that players can get the most out of the blade if they **swing it rhythmically**. Everything was going wonderfully…  

But…  

Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to make the mechanic distinguish between swinging and actually attacking. This means that if a player spams the sword right in front of a monster, the intended time reduction **doesn’t trigger** correctly.  

So, I made a change that allows the weapon to be used normally again, though it unfortunately reduces a bit of its depth. The time (3 seconds) is now static. Players can try to swing as much as possible within those 3 seconds, or use the range finisher, which will subtract all remaining time at once.  

Don’t worry though – I’ve **saved the old mechanic** and will try to bring it back with the help of more experienced people.  

Your weapon will now **function correctly**, but still keep the old description. If you want, just **put it in the magical bouncing box** at the Soul Station and **update its description** there!  

Thanks for your patience, everyone!
