Hey @everyone!

First off… I want to say thank you for your patience. I know it’s been a while, and I’m really sorry for the wait. But the good news? We’re back, fully ready, and better than ever!

**ENTER THE VOID UPDATE**

The server is repaired , fully accessible, and ready to bring you all the fun, chaos, and adventure you’ve been waiting for. I truly hope you’ll enjoy it as much as I’ve enjoyed rebuilding it.

And there’s more — check out the latest videos, dive into the newest modpack (  <#1398423296856297563>  ), and explore everything that’s changed. I think you’re going to love the updates, the new features, and the surprises we’ve been cooking up behind the scenes.

So gear up, jump in, and let’s make the Void Tales community bigger, better, and more exciting than ever before!

Welcome back to the adventure. Let’s play!


P.S. I had to reset all player data. I’m really sorry about that — please don’t be mad! Here’s to starting fresh, and I’ve got plans in place so this won’t happen again.
