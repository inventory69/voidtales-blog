I need a break, I'm really sorry.  

&nbsp;  

No matter what I try, I'm failing in every area right now.  

I want to continue building and developing Chapter 2 with all the quests, new weapon upgrades, gemstones, everything.  

I would like to revise the tutorial and all previous quests with a much better system in which you have the option to give different answers and the NPC can react differently, which allows for a lot more depth. In addition, all gemstones should get their own description to give the lore more depth.  

And we finally need a new mode, where it's still not 100 percent clear whether it's a roguelike dungeon, housing, or PvP, which would be my favorite, to be honest.  

&nbsp;  

But I'm burned out right now, I can't think of anything, and I'm just staring at my screen. I'm glad I just implemented Combat 2.0.  

So I'm taking a break, which will probably last 2 or 3 weeks. Void Tales will of course continue, and even if no one feels like playing right now, our moderators are still there for you ❤️
