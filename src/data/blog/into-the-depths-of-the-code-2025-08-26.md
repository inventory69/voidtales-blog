"Rebuilding the server, they said. Fixing a few performance issues, they said. Only a couple of days, they said…"

Well @everyone … Falwhind alone took me over 2 days, and I’ve already been working on Soul Station for more than 2 days as well. It’s honestly hilarious how everything is connected — the more you fix, the more little things you discover that also need fixing.

Like, suddenly you remember: “Hey, didn’t someone once ask if shop items that are limited could actually show that beforehand?” …and then you think: “Wait, how does that even work?” Next thing you know, you’re deep in another fix.

But hey, it’s paying off! No more weird totems, no mobs that refuse to despawn or stick around forever. Everything is running smoother, and we’re making real progress.

The promised Void Tales is coming soon™.
Thanks a lot to all of you for the patience and support!


P.S.

The changes are better than you think!
