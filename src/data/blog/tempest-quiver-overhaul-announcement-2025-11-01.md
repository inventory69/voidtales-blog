The Tempest Quiver has been redesigned @everyone !  

You can now carry a maximum of 3 knives instead of 5. If you already have 3 knives, acquiring a fourth is impossible. All old knives — Bleeding Knife, Chain Knife, and Echo Knife — have been removed from the game.  

All 5 status effects in the game are now usable through the quiver. However, a single enemy cannot be affected by the same status effect twice. This means that during coordinated fights, such as multiple players against a boss, careful planning is required, but strong combinations are still possible.  

Gem interactions with the Tempest Quiver have been expanded. You can now combine gems that, for example, increase damage against enemies affected by status effects or boost damage for a short time against enemies hit by Tempest Quiver knives.  

The Mosslights, which are connected to Mosslight Mara, now have a new lore background. This will gradually become noticeable through environmental storytelling, item descriptions, or NPC interactions.  

Players experiencing the quest for the first time will automatically receive the updated version. Existing owners simply need to equip the quiver, and the update will apply automatically.  

We believe these changes improve the system significantly over the previous version. Extensive testing by our usual suspects is highly encouraged.  

&nbsp;  

In love, Mossli- uh, Shin  

React with your favourite status effect!
