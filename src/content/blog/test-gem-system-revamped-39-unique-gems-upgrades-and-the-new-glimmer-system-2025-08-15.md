The entire Gem system has been revised  @everyone and restructured. Instead of complicated combinations, there is now a clear, expanded system with 39 unique gems that can be crafted selectively or randomly - and can all be used universally.

Uniform Gem system
There is now only one Gem type. Every Gem now fits in every slot - whether weapon or armor. No sorting, no puzzling - just use it and get started.

39 individual Gems - each with upgrade level
From additional attacks and passive healing to status effects, chains, bombs, rain bonuses or money on hits - the effects are more varied than ever. All gems can be upgraded and gain stronger effects at level 2. Some examples:

    Chance of additional attack with Loyalty

    Poison damage after consuming certain items

    Passive chance of Phia Lumine or Whisper

    Money or Shelley on hit

    Rain and snow-based damage bonuses

Crafting rethought - more control, more options
Gems can now be crafted via Glimmer:

    For 10 Glimmer: a random Gem

    For 20 Glimmer: a random Gem of a selected category (Vessel, Hollow or Rift)

    For a high price: a specifically selected gem

Glimmer replaces old shard mechanic
Shards have been completely replaced by Glimmer. There is now only one resource to craft - clear, elegant and consistent. Glimmer is now much more common:

    Dungeon bosses drop a Glimmer Chest when defeated

   Glimmer veins appear more frequently and give significantly more yield than before

The new system is designed to be easier to understand while offering more depth and rewards - with real freedom of choice and visible progress.
