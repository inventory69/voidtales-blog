I wanted to share something with you, though I'm not exactly sure why. Am I trying to build some hype? Maybe a little.
Is it just this urge to share how I feel? Most likely.
This won’t be the most professional message — but it’s honest.

Right now, I’m playtesting my own game: Void Tales.
I started fresh, just like any regular player would — everything reset.
And honestly? I can’t believe how far we’ve come.

I'm filled with joy just doing this, and I’ve even found a few bugs that none of the testers mentioned — probably because they thought it was intentional (no blame, of course!).

But back to the real point: the progress we’ve made is incredible.
While looking for bugs, I found myself falling in love with the game all over again.

I have to say, the atmosphere is by far Void Tales' strongest aspect. But it’s the little things that keep making me smile while I play.
Like the music. The NPCs. The bosses.
Moments like:
“Hey, I just spoke to this NPC and got a little pop-up message saying new dialogue options have been unlocked with another character.”

I've probably played for about 4 hours now, and although I know where everything is, I haven't gotten very far.

I caught myself being totally hooked. I just want to keep playing.
Will you feel the same?
Maybe. Maybe not.
But I think I’ve built something that I truly love — and if you think a little bit like me, there’s a good chance you’ll love it too.

And if I manage to add things like housing or PvP after release… it could become something even more beautiful.

I don’t even want to go to sleep right now — but I probably should.
So I’ll lay my head down, happily in love with what we’ve built, and look forward to polishing things up again tomorrow.
Getting rid of the last bugs — like curing the final little sicknesses.

Sleep well, and thank you for being here. 💜
